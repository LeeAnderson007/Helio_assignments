    <article>Computer science is the study of computation and information.[1][2] 
        Computer science deals with theory of computation, algorithms, 
        computational problems and the design of computer systems hardware, 
        software and applications.[3][4] Computer science addresses both 
        human-made and natural information processes, such as communication, 
        control, perception, learning and intelligence especially in human-made 
        computing systems and machines.[5][6][7] According to Peter Denning, 
        the fundamental question underlying computer science is, What can be automated?[8][5]
        Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. 
        Computational complexity theory is highly abstract, while computer graphics 
        and computational geometry emphasizes real-world applications. Algorithmics 
        is called the heart of computer science.[9] Programming language theory 
        considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while 
        software engineering involves the use of programming languages and complex systems. 
        Computer architecture and computer engineering deals with construction of computer 
        components and computer-controlled equipment.[5][10] Human–computer interaction 
        considers the challenges in making computers useful, usable, and accessible. 
        Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as 
        problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, motion planning, 
        learning, and communication found in humans and animals.

        <article>The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the 
            invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed 
            numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding 
            in computations such as multiplication and division. Algorithms for performing 
            computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of 
            sophisticated computing equipment.

            Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator 
            in 1623.[13] In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, 
            called the Stepped Reckoner.[14] Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist 
            and information theorist, for, among other reasons, documenting the binary number system. 
            In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry[note 1] when he invented 
            his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to 
            be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic 
            mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the 
            first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.[15] He started developing this 
            machine in 1834, and "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features 
            of the modern computer".[16] "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived 
            from the Jacquard loom"[16] making it infinitely programmable.[note 2] In 1843, during the translation 
            of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, 
            an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm 
            ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer.[17] Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented 
            the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became 
            part of IBM. Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published [18] 
            the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. In 1937, one hundred years 
            after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card 
            equipment and was also in the calculator business[19] to develop his giant programmable calculator, 
            the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central 
            computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".[20]
        
            During the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the 
            Atanasoff–Berry computer and ENIAC, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than 
            their human predecessors.[21] As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just 
            mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general. 
            In 1945, IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in New York City. 
            The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side was IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure 
            science. The lab is the forerunner of IBM's Research Division, which today operates research facilities 
            around the world.[22] Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and the university was instrumental 
            in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic-credit 
            courses in computer science in 1946.[23] Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic 
            discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.[5][24] The world's first computer science degree program, 
            the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory 
            in 1953. The first computer science department in the United States was formed at Purdue University 
            in 1962.[25] Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become 
            distinct areas of study in their own rights.
        
            Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a 
            scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic 
            population.[26][27] It is the now well-known IBM brand that formed part of the computer science 
            revolution during this time. IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704[28] 
            and later the IBM 709[29] computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices.
            "Still, working with the IBM [computer] was frustrating […] if you had misplaced as much as one letter 
            in one instruction, the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over 
            again".[26] During the late 1950s, the computer science discipline was very much in its 
            developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.[27]
        
            The concept of a field-effect transistor was proposed by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925. 
            John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs, built 
            the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in 1947.[30][31] In 1953, 
            the University of Manchester built the first transistorized computer, called the Transistor Computer.
            [32] However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to 
            manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications.
            [33] The metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistor (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed 
            Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959.[34][35] It was the first truly compact transistor that 
            could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses.[33] The MOSFET made it possible 
            to build high-density integrated circuit chips,[36][37] leading to what is known as the computer 
            revolution[38] or microcomputer revolution.[39]
        
            Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computing technology.
            [40] Modern society has seen a significant shift in the demographics which make use of computer 
            technology; usage has shifted from being mostly exclusive to experts and professionals, to a 
            near-ubiquitous user base. Initially, computers were quite costly, and some degree of humanitarian 
            aid was needed for efficient use—in part from professional computer operators. As computer adoption 
            became more widespread and affordable, less human assistance was needed for common usage.
